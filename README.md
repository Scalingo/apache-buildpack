# Apache BuildPack
This BuildPack will install the Apache2 web server using the apt-buildpack.

## Configuration

If an `apache.conf.erb` is present at the root of your project, it will be
rendered (useing ERB template system) and included in the default
configuration.

## Apache modules

You can install custom apache modules by adding a `.apache-mods` file at the root
of your project. It must include one module per line.

Example:

```
